# 1. User stories

 - As a user, I want to be able to use my browser wallet with the site, so that I can seamlessly connect my account using software I can trust.
 - As a user, I want a convenient way to discover NFTs, so that I can bid on or start new crowdfunding projects.
 - As a user, I want a profile page, so that I can customize my profile with pictures and custom information about myself for other users to see along with any nfts I currently own.
 - As a user, I want to be able to start or join a crowdfunding project on the website, so I can conviently purchase the NFTs.
 - As a user, I want integration with various blockchain networks, so that I can compare transaction fees.
 - As a user, I want a token to represent the share of my contribution, so that I can sell it and/or trade with others.
 - As a user, I want to be able to view my purchases on the app, so that I dont have to manually make complicated queries on the blockchain.

User stories were initially planned through Github project boards and are available [here](https://github.com/users/Cameronketchem/projects/1/views/2).

# 2. What issues did your team plan to address?

1. Creating the initial front end of the website to allow future functionality of buying NFTs from the website:
 - [Feat: Implementation of Welcome page with routing to a login and signup page](https://github.com/Cameronketchem/CEN3031-Group91/pull/5)
2. Creating a database utility to interface with SQLite:
 - [Created database utility and datastore](https://github.com/Cameronketchem/CEN3031-Group91/pull/4)
3. Creating representations of SQL tables as custom Golang data structures:
 - [Created database utility and datastore](https://github.com/Cameronketchem/CEN3031-Group91/pull/4)
4. Set up a basic API:
 - [Basic API](https://github.com/Cameronketchem/CEN3031-Group91/issues/7)

# 3. Which ones were successfully completed?

A working front end that can be improved and built upon was successfully created.

Different types that are necessary for the backend were created, these types include contracts, assets, users, and contributions.

We now can store user information with a wallet, and have backend files that set up the database and running the backend.

# 4. Which ones didn't and why?

We did not get the basic API set up yet because it was started and not finished yet for this sprint.
